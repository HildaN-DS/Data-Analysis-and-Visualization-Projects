### 1. 🌍 [The Euro's Journey Through Global Events](https://github.com/HildaN-DS/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Projects/blob/main/The%20Euro's%20Journey%20Through%20Global%20Events.ipynb)
This project analyzes how the Euro's exchange rate responded to major global events:

- **2008 Global Financial Crisis**
- **2016–2020 Brexit & Trump Era**
- **2020–2022 COVID-19 Pandemic**

By examining the Euro's performance against key currencies (USD, GBP, INR, JPY, CHF, CNY), the analysis reveals how market sentiment, policy decisions, and geopolitical shifts influence exchange rates.
